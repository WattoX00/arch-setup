# My Arch Linux Installation script
Makes it cleaner and faster to my liking.

Inspired by [ChristitusTech](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech)

## Installation

1. ``` curl -fsSL https://wattox00.github.io/arch-setup.sh | sh ```
2. After a fresh login write these commands:
    ```bash
    bash dwm-wattox.sh
    ```
3. This will run the isntallation script and will ask for sudo permission a few times
4. For maximum safety reboot and run ``` bash cleanup.sh ```

See here what window manager it installs: [dwm-wattox](https://github.com/WattoX00/dwm-wattox)
